Create column Ä±f date table is in the last sale date.
Dax function of the code.
Inpast = 
var lastsalesdate = MAX(fact_Sales[Date_Time])
var lastsalesdatePY =EDATE(lastsalesdate,-12)
return
Dim_date[Date]<= lastsalesdatePY

Calculate sales based on previous date values by using dim_dates in measures.
DAX function:
PYTD_Sales = 
CALCULATE([Sales],
                    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_date[Date]),Dim_date[Inpast]=TRUE) 

Calculate YTD by using measures:
YTD_Sales = TOTALYTD([Sales],fact_Sales[Date_Time])


Create Slider from SLC_values
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b138c283-7fa4-4db5-a946-cd7f08a2107e)

In this slicers, i created measure table using dax formula below:
S_PYTD = 
var selected_value = SELECTEDVALUE(SLC_values[Values])
var result = SWITCH(selected_value,
    "Sales",[PYTD_Sales],
    "Quantity",[PYTD_Quantity],
    "Gross_Profit",[PYTD_Gross_Profit],
    BLANK())
RETURN result

I used same formula to YTD and PYTD vs YTD slicers.
